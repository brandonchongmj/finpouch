    <h1>What is finpouch about?</h1>
    <p>Finpouch is the first banking app that helps you organize your money!</p>

    <h1>What is this app based on?</h1>
    <p> Fin pouch is based on the envelope budgeting method that helps allocate cash into various envelopes for specific expenses.</p>
    <p>For instance, when Andy receives his money every month, he would bring a physical envelope labeled "Main (100%)" to the ATM machine to withdraw all his salary for the month.</p>
    <p>Once he gets home, he then bring our several other envelopes with preset percentage allocations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Daily expenses (30%)</li>
        <li>Rent (40%)</li>
        <li>Guilt-free fun money (10%)</li>
        <li>investment (10%)</li>
        <li>Annual holiday trip (10%)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With this fixed allocation every month, Andy is able to pay for his expenses without any issues every month, and is able to have a guilt-free money every month to buy his favourite video games and figurines, while also setting aside an amount as investment for his future. </p>

    <h1>How we make this process easier!</h1>
    <p>Now, what FinPouch does is digitalise and simplify this process for you! Once you register your banking account with us, whenever your monthly income comes in, it will first enter your main bank account. Then, with just a click of a button, the banking app will automatically allocate the funds into the preset sub accounts that you set! Not only that, each bank account comes with direct <strong>Paynow</strong> so you can pay for all your expenses directly from the sub bank account itself! Say goodbye to physical envelopes or having to reallocate your money into different bank accounts yourself every month (like i used to do xD)</p>
